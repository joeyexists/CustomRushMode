# CustomRushMode
A mod for Neon White that lets you play custom rushes beyond just Mikey Mode! Works in both full-game rushes and individual levels.

## Included Rush Modes:
- Purify Rush
- Elevate Rush
- Godspeed Rush
- Stomp Rush
- Fireball Rush
- Dominion Rush
- Random Rush

You can enable the mod and change the rush type via Melon Preferences.

## Important Notes
- This mod uses NeonLite's built in anti-cheat, so make sure you have the latest version of [NeonLite](https://github.com/Faustas156/NeonLite) installed.
- These rushes have not been tested for playabilityâ€”some levels may be impossible.
